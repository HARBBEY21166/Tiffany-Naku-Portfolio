Tired of seeing the same static portfolio templates everywhere? What if your next portfolio project could not only display work beautifully, but also intelligently guide visitors to the most relevant content?

Welcome to the open-source engine behind the portfolio of award-winning designer Tiffany Naku. We're not just offering a template; we're giving you a launchpad for a smarter, more engaging creative showcase.

## Getting Started: You're 2 Commands Away!

We believe that great software should be a joy to work with from the very first moment. That's why we've made the setup process as simple as possible.

1.  **Install the essentials:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  **Start the magic:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

That's it. Your development server is running. Welcome to the future of portfolio design.

## What's Next? Make It Your Own

You've got the site running, now it's time to shape it into your own masterpiece. Here's where to look:

-   **`src/lib/data.ts`**: This is the heart of your content. Swap in your own projects, update the "About Me" section, and add your client testimonials. No need to dig through components.
-   **`public/images`**: Drop your high-resolution project images and branding assets here.
-   **`tailwind.config.ts`**: Love the vibrant purple and electric blue? Great! If not, this is the place to infuse your own color palette and style.

## The Vision: Beyond the Pixels

We built this because we believe that a portfolio should be more than a static gallery; it should be an experience. It should tell a story, spark a conversation, and create a connection. By open-sourcing the Tiffany Naku project, we hope to empower developers and designers to build portfolios that are as dynamic and creative as the work they contain.

## üí´ From Our Studio to Yours

We can't wait to see what incredible experiences you'll build with the portfolio. Tag us on Twitter or show us your creations, we'd love to feature them
