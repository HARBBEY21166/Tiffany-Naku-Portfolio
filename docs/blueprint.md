## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant purple (#9400D3) to evoke creativity and sophistication.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0), a very low saturation level, almost imperceptible hue; chosen for a neutral, modern background that emphasizes the work.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) as a visually contrasting highlight that creates a contemporary look and 'pops' the key visual elements.

- Use minimalist icons, preferably line icons, for navigation and social media links.
- Grid-based layout to organize portfolio pieces effectively. Consider a masonry layout for dynamic content presentation.
